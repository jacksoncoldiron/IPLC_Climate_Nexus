Bren MESM Group Project repo for Assessing Climate Risks to Indigenous Peoples & Local Communities and the Nature within their Territories

## Project Overview

**Collaborators:** Jackson Coldiron, Garrett Craig, Isa Elias, Justin Gutierrez and Bella Pucker

**Client:** Conservation International

**Objectives:**
  1) Produce global and regional (Amazonia) maps of 8 major climate change impacts and risks to IPs &
     LCs, their territories, and the biodiversity and carbon within these regions.
  2) Identify Nature-based Solutions (NbS) needed to reduce the climate impact on IPs & LCs in
     Amazonia and the nature within their territories.
  3) Develop regional policy recommendations that promote IPs & LCs’ implementation of NbS toward
     climate resilience and biodiversity conservation.

## Data Sources

**IPs & LCs Territories & Tenure:**

- IPs & LCs’ Territories & Tenure (Sushma et al., 2024). Provides geospatial datasets corresponding to
legally recognized, collectively, and communally governed or managed IPs & LCs’ lands and waters
covering 9.8 M km2 across 57 countries.

**Climate & Carbon:**

- Climate Vulnerability (Donatti et al., 2023). Identifies vulnerability of the global human population
to 8 major climate impacts–river and coastal floods, heatwave, wildfire, food security, landslide,
vector borne diseases, water stress–and locates areas where conservation, restoration, or improved
land management could potentially reduce human vulnerability to climate impacts.

- Irrecoverable Carbon (Noon et al., 2022). Offers maps and data on carbon vulnerable to human
influence that if lost, could not be restored within 30 years.

- Biomass Carbon Density (Spawn et al., 2020). Presents a global map of carbon density within
terrestrial ecosystems.

- Carbon Storage Potential (Walker et al., 2022). Assesses current and future unrealized potential
carbon storage under RCP8.5 out to 2050.

**Biodiversity:**

- Red List of Threatened Species (IUCN, 2024). Contains spatial data for over 130,000 species,
including mammals, amphibians, birds, reptiles, and plants.

- Species Richness and Rarity-Weighted Richness (IUCN, 2024). Indicates relative importance by
proportionally accounting for individual species’ habitat range.
● Red List Species Habitat Suitability (Brooks et al., 2019). Refines species ranges from the IUCN Red
List by focusing on habitat suitability.
